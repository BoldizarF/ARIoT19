# ARIoT19 - Cerberus the guard dog
The complete contribution from APTIV Code Constructors Artic IoT Challenge 2019

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The project uses a large number of different microcontrollers and other platforms.

#### Software
```
Arduino IDE
Android studio, minimum SDK is set to Oreo
SSH
```

#### Hardware
```
Wemos D32
Raspberry pi 3B
Arduino uno
Motorcontroller shield
Robot-03 Car kit for Arduino
IR-sensor
4x Ultrasonic sensors
2x 4-slot AA battery holder
Rotor encoder (used as odometer)
USB camera
OLED display
Voltage upconverter 3.3 to 5V
Heartbeat pulse sensor
Temperature sensor
```

### Installing

The required software can be found through these links:
```
Android studio: https://developer.android.com/studio
Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
SSH is included with most operating systems
```

#### The different hardwares
The car consists of the following hardwares:
```
Raspberry pi 3B
Arduino uno
Motorcontroller shield
Robot-03 Car kit for Arduino
IR-sensor
4x Ultrasonic sensors
2x 4-slot AA battery holder
Rotor encoder (used as odometer)
USB camera
```

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Project practices

### Test Cases
We understand that writing tests are boring so we as a project have adapted the YOLO mindset.
Skip the test cases and just be happy....

### Code style
Same here, you are unique as an individual. All code is beautiful!

## Deployment
Information about how to get the system up n running

### Cloud
```
1. Build the WatchDogApi
2. Create a zip archive of: 
    - WatchDogApi folder 
    - Dockerfile
    - WatchDogApi.sln
3. Upload the zip to your Elastic Beanstalk on AWS 
```

### Android Dashboard
```
1. Open the app-android project in Android Studio
2. Connect your tablet
3. Press 'Run'
```

### Arduino
