# ARIoT19 - Cerberus the guard dog
The complete contribution from APTIV Code Constructors Artic IoT Challenge 2019

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The project uses a large number of different microcontrollers and other platforms.

#### Software
```
Arduino IDE
Android studio with Android Oreo
SSH
```

#### Hardware
```
Wemos D32
Raspberry pi 3B
Arduino uno
Motorcontroller shield
Robot-03 Car kit for Arduino
IR-sensor
4x Ultrasonic sensors
2x 4-slot AA battery holder
Rotor encoder (used as odometer)
USB camera
OLED display
Voltage upconverter 3.3 to 5V
Pulse sensor
Temperature sensor
```

### Installing

The required software can be found through these links:
```
Android studio: https://developer.android.com/studio
Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
SSH is included with most operating systems
```

The different hardwares are connected like this:
```

```

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
